## Studying the patterns that determine the success of games and gaming platforms ðŸŽ®

[Gaming platforms](https://github.com/adwise1990/portfolio_files/blob/main/gaming_platforms_en.ipynb)

**Description:** Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, identify patterns that determine the success of a game


The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. Compiled portraits of users in each region. Verified
hypotheses: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The analysis used Student's t-test for independent samples.

**Skills and tools:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, testing of statistical hypotheses


## Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application ðŸ“±

[A|A|B Testing](https://github.com/adwise1990/portfolio_files/blob/main/aab-testing.ipynb) 

**Description:** Analyze the sales funnel and evaluate the results of A/A/B testing based on data from the use of a mobile application for selling food products

In this project, I studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, explored the path of users to purchase. Analyzed the results of an A/B test for introducing new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It is revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.

**Skills and tools:** A/B testing, Python, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, event analytics, product metrics, testing of statistical hypotheses, data visualization


## Evaluate A/B test results (Business decision making) ðŸ§ª

[Evaluate A/B test results](https://github.com/adwise1990/portfolio_files/blob/main/AB_decision_making.ipynb)

**Description:** Using the data of the online store, prioritize hypotheses, evaluate the results of A / B testing using various methods

Analyzed the results of the A/B test, built graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by groups, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks for raw and cleaned data. Based on the analysis, I decided that it was not advisable to continue the test.

**Skills and tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, A/B testing, testing of statistical hypotheses
